## Purpose of E-Schools-Ke progressive web app
This is a dynamic web app that allows adding, deleting and editing pages online. At the moment the existing pages are ' Become a Tutor' , 'Upcoming Events' and 'Contacting the admin'. 
- Become A Tutor - enables a user to submits his or her details and at the bottom it shows available tutors after the button is clicked.
- Upcoming Events- shows sports and educational events coming up including dates and location.
- Contact Us - allows the user to send a message to the creator or admin. In this case i receive the user's message on my email account.

- The 'Manage Site' tab acts as the backend. It can add more files, edit, delete and even create child categories in existing files

## Technology used
The files are written in php following best practices like data validation, simple programming. Also [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) manages the dependencies and MySql was used as a local database.
I used https://www.000webhost.com/ to host the web app by following these steps;
   - Uploading all my files to the file manager
   - Setting up the database since it has its own host/ phpmyadmin (https://databases.000webhost.com). I provided db name, username and      password and used php functions in the files to connect to that database.
 

## Service worker , manifest, offline, security headers, apis and webpack 
- I created a [service worker](https://github.com/SharonLagat/E-Schools-Ke/blob/master/sw.js) and [manifest](https://github.com/SharonLagat/E-Schools-Ke/blob/master/manifest.json/) by following online tutorials. In the service worker i listed all the assets (php,css,js..) to cache and then stored the API responses in IndexedDB to enable them to be retrieved when a user re-connects.
- A .htaccess file was generated by the site i used to host. I enabled Experimental Web Features on chrome://flags/. Once i'm well-versed with it i will use .htaccess for more functionality.
- To enable Subresource integrity one has to upgrade to another plan which is not free in the web host so i didnt use it.
- I used one workbox webpack following this tutorial [here](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/guides/get-started/) which allows you to listen for requests from your web page and determine if and how that request should be cached and responded to. This only works if you have an updated chrome otherwise it gives a violation.
- Used Google fonts API to add fonts to web pages.
- As for security the web app is a secure since the site has a valid server certificate.
