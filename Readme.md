## Purpose of E-Schools-Ke progressive web app
This is a dynamic web app that allows for adding deleting and editing pages online. At the moment the existing pages are ' Become a Tutor' , 'Upcoming Events' and 'Contacting the admin'. 
- Become A Tutor - enables a user to submits details below it shows available tutors after the button is clicked.
- Upcoming Events- shows sports and educational events coming up including dates and location.
- Contact Us - allows for the user to send a message to the creator or admin. In this case i receive the users message on my email account.

- The 'Manage Site' tab acts as the backend. It can add more files, edit, delete and even create child categories in existing files

## Technology used
The files are written in php. Also [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) manages the dependencies and MySql as a local database.
I used https://www.000webhost.com/ to host the web app by following these steps;
   - Uploading all my files to the file manager
   - Setting up the database since it has its own host/ phpmyadmin (https://databases.000webhost.com). I provided db name, username and      password and used php functions in the files to connect to that database.
 

## Service worker , manifest, offline, security headers, apis and webpack 
- I created a [service worker](https://github.com/user/repo/blob/branch/other_file.md) and [manifest](https://github.com/user/repo/blob/branch/other_file.md) through following tutorials.
