## Purpose of E-Schools-Ke progressive web app
This is a dynamic web app that allows for adding deleting and editing pages online. At the moment the existing pages are ' Become a Tutor' , 'Upcoming Events' and 'Contacting the admin'. 
- ' Become a Tutor' - A user submits details and after submitting the details appear under available tutors.
- 'Upcoming Events' shows sports and educational events coming up including dates and location.
- 'Contact Us' allows for the user to send a message to the creator or admin.

- The 'Manage site' tab acts as the backend. It can add more files, edit, delete and even create child categories in existing files

## Technology used
I used 000webhost to host the web app.
Luckily it allows access to database through its own host/ phpmyadmin (https://databases.000webhost.com) so i provided the db name, username and password and used php functions to connect to that database.

## Service worker , manifest, offline, security headers, apis and webpack 
I used composer for the libraries in my php project. There's a service worker and manifest.json too.
